# SWR-detection

SWR-detection is a collection of Spike2 scripts to help you detect the onset and termination of sharp-wave ripples and cortical slow waves. 
It is written for rodent recordings of the hippocampus and cortex. 
The program uses sleep states detected by [Sleep Stage Detection](https://ced.co.uk/files/scripts/RatSleepAuto.zip) to restrict the search for sharp-wave ripples and slow waves to NREM periods. If you also have detected spikes, the program will output peri-event histograms referenced to the onset of the sharp-wave ripple and waveform averages calculated from LFP channels.
